        <p>Fashion designers do more than design clothes – they give people the confidence to express themselves and bring people together as a society. With so many different styles and trends, fashion can be so much more than clothing. It can be a political statement, such as during the suffragette movement, or simply a form of self-expression. Fashion designers influence entire generations with their trends and so it is no surprise that some will never be forgotten, and that their trends will always influence current styles. This website aims to introduce some of the most iconic designers of all time, how their fashion has influenced the world, and compare their impacts.</p>

                  <p>Christian Dior (1905-1957) was a French Fashion designer who heavily influenced fashion after the second World War (Britannica, 2021). After illustrating fashion for a few years during the 1930s, he was Robert Piguet’s assistant designer for four years before joining Lucien Lelong’s fashion house in 1942. Dior created his most famous trend in 1947 – the “New Look.” It was drastically different to the fashion at the time and therefore the new silhouette sparked controversy. While he passed away only 10 years later, he remained successful and created many on the silhouettes still used today, including the A-line. Yves Saint Laurent took over the Dior fashion house after his death as he was working as his assistant.</p>

                        Dior’s “New Look” was created in February 1947 and became immensely popular due to its silhouette being drastically different from other fashion at the time, which was being influenced by the war (Monet, 2021). It combined a full skirt with a cinched waist and small shoulders. It is said the look got its name when Bazaar’s editor in chief, Carmel Snow, told Dior that his dresses “have such a new look.”

                        The year after his “New Look,” Dior focused on making his products “ready-to-wear,” making them more casual and therefore easily accessible for the general public (Monet, 2021). He used fabrics that could be used efficiently in machines which led to his designs being purchased by fashion companies so that they could be produced widely while he still received royalties on each item. In fact, Dior earnt half of the entire Parisian couture industry in 1950 alone.

                  <p>Chanel (1883-1971) was a lead fashion designer for Parisian couture for decades. She focused on simplicity and so many of her designs have remained relevant thanks to their timeless look (Britannica, 2021). She not only greatly influenced the fashion world, but her fashion house also worked with jewelry and perfumes which led to her success with Chanel No. 5. Chanel closed her fashion house in 1939 due to the second World War but came back with her signature suit design in 1954. Karl Lagerfeld was one of the most notable designers to lead Chanel’s fashion house after her death in 1971.</p>

                        Women wearing trousers became common during the war, but Chanel helped to make them fashionable (Cerini, 2021). She popularised flowy trousers and often wore them herself, particularly paired with baggy or sleeveless tops.

                        Chanel took influence from French sailors and turned their striped shirts into high-end fashion for women (Cerini, 2021). She would accessorise them with bold belts or pockets and create them in a jersey material. They are still very popular and widely worn today.

                        “The Little Black Dress” is still a phrase used today. Chanel’s drawing of a simple black dress with a pearl necklace was published in 1926 by Vogue and soon became popular (Cerini, 2021). It was quickly coined “a sort of uniform for all women of taste” due to its simplicity which made it accessible to all.

                        One of Chanel’s most famous influences is her tweed suit which she created inspired by menswear (Cerini, 2021). They combined the silhouette that women had become used to during the war with more comfort than what they wore before. The Chanel Suit consists of a collarless jacket and a small skirt, and was worn by many famous women, such as Audrey Hepburn and Princess Diana.
